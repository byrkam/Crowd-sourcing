# Crowd-sourcing
A website implementation where a user can place relevant data (JSON) and observe statistic produced, about a variety of indications, such as places visited, visit frequency, etc.

For the back end visualization we used XAMPP apache and MySQL server.
Files that are compatible with the application we developed can be found Google takeouts ---> Location History ----> JSON format.

In case your upload file is too big you can use halaxa, salsify or composer parsers for JSON data.
